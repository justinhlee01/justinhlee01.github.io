        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Running has been a part of my life for few years. Started since high
          school joining the cross country team, but it quickly became a
          passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy the sense of accomplishment after a long run and the
          peacefulness of early morning runs.

        <h2>When to Run?</h2>
        <p>
          The best time to run depends on your schedule and preferences. Many
          people enjoy running in the early morning or late evening to avoid the
          heat.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some popular times to run and their benefits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Morning:</strong> Cooler temperatures and energizes you for the day. However, it can be hard to wake up early.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evening:</strong> Relieves stress and cooler temperatures. However, it can interfere with dinner or sleep.
          </li>
        </ul>
